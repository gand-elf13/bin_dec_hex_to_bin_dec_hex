introduce_program is a function that simply prints a description about the program.
It takes no arguments, and returns None.
This function is executed before the program starts.

get_str_list_conversions is a function taking a list containing dictionaries (conversions) and
returns a list containing a text summarising each conversions dictionary. As such,
it returns a list of string, whilst taking a list of dictionaries as a parameter.

saves all conversions done whilst using the program, unless the user decided to exit mid-process...
