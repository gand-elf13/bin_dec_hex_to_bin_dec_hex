To do so, `convert_to_hex` takes two arguments : `n`, the string containing the integer, and `base`, the string indicating `n`'s base.\n\nThis function first checks the argument `base` and returns the result of the adequate function : if the initial base is decimal, then it will return the result of `convert_dec_to_hex (n)`, for example. If the initial base is hexadecimal, just like the final base, we just return n converted to string, in case `n` wasn't passed as a string.\n\nIf the base is not identified or is not supported yet, we return an error. Although this shouldn't happen, since the `ParseInput.py` module checks the input's validity, we kept this. Otherwise the whole program would have crashed if the other module's control didn't work out.",

We continue dividing until the quotient of the division is equal to zero. In that case, we reverse the list of remainders we have gotten and we have now the result of our conversion. The remainders are conserved in the string called `converted_n`.\n\nIn case n appears to be a negative number contained in a string, we take out the minus sign during the algorithm, and then we put it back before returning it, as it logically should still be negative, despite its base.",

Provided it isn't, we use the remainder as a key in a dictionary containing the coefficients with their corresponding letters (10 for a, 11 for b, 12 for c, etc.), which then returns the value paired with that key-remainder in that same dictionary (cf data structures in python).\nWe chose to use a dictionary rather than a mountain of `elif`s, since it is:\n* cleaner ;\n* shorter ;\n* easier to read ;\n* simpler.\n\nThis function can also be used as for help to developpers needing to convert a remainder that could be higher than our hexadecimal base, as we can expand a dictionary as we wish, instead of creating another `elif` statement with its own block, with its own lines of code.

The syntax for python's slicing method is `[start_index_included : end_index_excluded : step]` using only integers. Since we want to use the whole string, we do not need to specify the start and the end index, that's why we can leave it blank, as Python understands that we want to use the whole string. The step is what interests us. The default step (right-to-left reading) is 1. So to read from left-to-right, it logically should be -1.
